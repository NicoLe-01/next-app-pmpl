          Batik is a technique of wax-resist dyeing applied to whole cloth. It
          originated in Java, Indonesia, and has been practiced for centuries.
          The word "batik" comes from the Javanese word "ambatik," which means
          "wax writing." The oldest known batik fabric was discovered in Egypt
          and dates back to the 4th century AD, although it is not clear whether
          the fabric was made in Indonesia or not. Batik reached its peak of
          artistic and technical excellence in Java in the 19th century, during
          the reign of Sultan Hamengkubuwono III. During this period, batik
          designs became more intricate, and the use of natural dyes and a
          variety of wax-resist techniques created a distinctive Javanese style.
          After Java was annexed by the Dutch in the early 20th century, batik
          became a popular export product. The Dutch introduced new designs and
          color schemes, and batik became a symbol of Indonesian identity and a
          source of national pride. Today, batik is still an important part of
          Indonesian culture, and its popularity has spread around the world.
